    * An weekend long event where participants ideate, research, execute and try to bootstrap a startup with social focus.
  * My role
    * I was a technical mentor. My role was advising and showing possible pathways and help unlock teams that were blocked out by a tech problem.
  * take-aways
    * Technology doesn't mean anything if it is not solving a problem.
    * Being able to describe what kind of IRL problems a technological approach solves is paramount for being understood.
    * There are many solutions for social issues that don't require new technology but a remix or mashup of what we current have.
* Yamama: WebVR workshop for kids 
  * MozMike:  I love it when people report after a workshop  "I was impressed with how much the students knew and I wish we had even more time to dive deeper"
* Azzen : writing for a US Tech non profit

Questions
=========

Tushar: While speed is of great importance for end users, developers want better dev tools comparable to chrome. Are there any plans for developer engagement for Firefox Developer Tools like the one going on for Web Extensions? -  Question for Jason
