TechBriefing: Daniel Stenberg Live from Stockholm 
TITLE: "Web transport, today and tomorrow"

a look at HTTP - what it was, what it is now and how it'll change again soon. Covering HTTP/1, HTTP/2, QUIC and more.

Questions: ( please write your name in front you question/line)

- 3 most famous software that use Curl and we don't know - Curl is in everything, all the connected devices, servers, etc
- HTTP2 can be used to set different priority on different files (I got this question on a meetup and I said no because it is a task of the browser)
- Most interesting commands/hacks that curl let us to do 
- How does the WoT protocol will effect if implemented? Or do you think we can use the existing protocol
- I'm curious about the relationship between Queuing Times in HTTP1 and HTTP2 - and the challenges we face with Net Neutrality under attack in US.... (Havi) 
- Isn't QUIC only used for very certain places? For example some youtube? Or is that now in most places? - Rabimba
- What server should we use if you have to support QUIC? I could only find caddy (https://github.com/mholt/caddy) - Rabimba

Ossification - when protocols get brittle and you can't easily change and move away from back-compatibility. 

CURL is about to turn 20 years old - has changed a lot over time. 
we are getting better at open source. 
we always need help....
