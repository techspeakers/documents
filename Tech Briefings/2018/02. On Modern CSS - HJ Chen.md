Questions: 
    
Please add your name and your question here:
* Daniele: What is the most missing feature actually about CSS (media query for writing modes)
* Daniele: There is today the problem of CSS compatibility between browsers like few years ago?  now w/feature queries - there's progressive fallback... a groundbreaking change for CSS compatibility. also, websites don't have to look the same!! is that a bug? HJ says, that's a feature! 
* Mike: who is in charge of the specifications for CSS?
  * The CSS Working Group, a collection of professionals and developers,  meets to discuss and decide on standards for CSS 
  * https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/members.en.php3
* Kalyan : From developers point-of-view CSS always being a problem to work, so how does the modern CSS help, since we have many libraries for UI part? 
  * the UI libraries already contain CSS within, and the libraries are very prescriptive, and not as flexible... 
  * modern CSS can help you build a layout without building custom libraries, or extensive hacks to make layout 
* Does the complexity of the Grid have a significant impact on website performance?
  * I would say "No"  This is because most modern browsers that have support for Grid, are optimized to the point that a complex Grid will not impact the performance noticeably.  Take Firefox for example, Mozilla has already rewritten the code with Quantum and offers support for Grid.
