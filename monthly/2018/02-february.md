  * Web Payments are going to be big!
    * Showed pinpad/POS with 7+ ways to pay
  * Finding ways to bridge the web and the physical world.
  * Messaging is a big thing in Asia - dominant apps change per country, 
    * how these app silos can interact w/web is an opportunity
    * apps are failing... to deliver the bridge/app fatigue
    * Japan -> LINE
    * Developers in Japan/Vietnam -> Facebook
    * Nepal -> Viber/FB

    * Go speak on atypical events! Audiences are quite happy to speak to Mozilla
    * Build bridges with communities that we're not usually in contact
    * Don't rely only on CFPs, reach out directly as well.
      * Andre: Got my first couple talks this way, reaching out over email.
    * Community Silos
      * Went to different events and the audience didn't overlap. Some communities don't mix.
      * Find those walls and punch holes in it.
      * Engage with people who don't think like us.
    * Had a insightful conversation during a startup event as he validates the research from an audience member who was building a "uber for nurses" in Singapore and found out that a Web presence should be better than an app but her investors were adamant on app instead of web. She will use the knowledge shared by Dietrich to reach back to her investors with solid arguments in favor of a web approach. Takeaway: by going on atypical events, we can engage and have real impact into different communities.

Internal Speakers:

Michael:
   
Quick Notes:
 
* Invoices - Final call for 2017 invoices!!! Send these in before it's too late 
  * Link for the quide/form? https://on.tchspk.rs/guide <--TY

Tech Speakers can now access Slack!

* Ever wonder what is being discussed behind the scenes at Mozilla?  Now you can find out for yourself
* Tech Speakers and all NDA’d Mozillians can now access our organization’s Slack by logging in to Slack via SSO (using your GitHub Credentials)
  * Link: http://mozilla.slack.com/
* Remember to follow the Community Participation Guidelines in all of your interactions on Slack, failure to do this could result in the individual losing access to Slack.
* Remember that information shared in Slack may very well be confidential and may contain information that Mozilla is not yet ready to share with a larger audience.  Because of this, we ask you to always be mindful of the Mozilla non-disclosure agreement and to be wise about which information from Slack you share with a non-Mozilla NDA’d audience.

A new Tech Speakers website in the works !?!

* We are working with the Mozilla ParSys Team to design and build an official Tech Speaker presence hosted by Mozilla 
* We are targeting a completion date for this website before the end of Q3 2018.
* We are currently in the brainstorm and design phase and we need your input!
  * Take Action - Please Help us to identify the structure, features, and elements you would like in your website by adding your user stories in this document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JGLgmR4tP2c343ZNlw7v5D94hXr4Kv4tmuQlnX7U35s/edit
  * (not sure what a user story is exactly?)  You can read more about User Stories here: http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/user-story

Tech Speaker Onboarding:
* We are currently testing a new process for onboarding Tech Speakers
* The beta testers (two potential Tech Speakers) will begin this month by going through the training materials with 1-1 facilitators.

Questions for our presenters at the end of the call (time allowing): PLS add your name to the questions! 
* @ Dietrich -  you mentioned many different event and audience types from your year in Asia. Was there perhaps one audience category (or group) where you felt like your message might have been lost/unwelcomed/?
  * Thailand Startup Summit was a tough audience, even though I kept technical content to a minimum, i think I didn't take enough time to bring them around to the idea that apps setup barriers, before moving forward. I was also first thing in the morning, so none of us were awake fully 😅
  * Another type of audience that was difficult was in southern Nepal in Janakpur. Most of the audience were students who had no technical background at all. I wasn't informed until the last minute, so had to redo my slides right before the talk. I would've done it differently by doing more research on the audience first, separate from what the organizers said.

* @Dietrich - how was schenzen? Is it like living on the future? What impressed you the most there?
  * Parts were like living in the future! Watching a line of people pay 100% of the time with WeChat at a breakfast food counter, and the cook *never even looking up* because he could hear the *ding* of the WeChat payment sound... the old and the new.
  * I had joined a group of Dutch designers there to tour manufacturers, maker spaces and to attend Shenzhen Design Week. So I got a designer's view of IoT which was fascinating. Shenzhen is now designing for western companies instead of just making western designs, which is a huge shift.
    * Wow, that is a very big shift!
  * Also the electronics markets were amazing mostly because of the volume. One of the best parts is walking in the alleys behind the markets, where there are mountains of boxes and thousands of people hurrying around to ship everything.
  * I was most impressed by the pride in Shenzhen's "hacking" character - they find a way to get things done in creative ways in high volume and short amount of time. I think that life is not great for everyone, but the city definitely has awareness of the toughness of that life - most people are new residents moved from rural areas for better jobs.
    * Awesome, that was my impression from all I've heard. This approach of "hacking life, solving problems unconventional" resonates quite well with Brazilians (we call it the Brazilian way)
  *
